# AHRS Module Real-Time Evaluation

## 1. Description

This report presents the real-time performance analysis of the **AHRS (Attitude and Heading Reference System)** module in the FluxSand project. The module is responsible for calculating device orientation based on IMU data, using quaternion-based sensor fusion algorithms.

## 2. Function Execution Time

All timing results are derived from unit test logs using microsecond precision:

| Function             | Time (µs) |
|----------------------|-----------|
| Init & assignment    | 0.04      |
| Update()             | 0.35      |
| GetEulr()            | 16.56     |
| Output               | 34.78     |
| Verify               | 12.98     |
| **Total**            | **64.70** |

## 3. Analysis

- The **total time** required for a complete update and verification cycle in the AHRS module is **approximately 65 µs**, which is **well within acceptable real-time limits**.
- The **Output** and **GetEulr()** functions account for the majority of execution time, but remain consistently under 50 µs.
- With such low latency, the AHRS system can reliably support frame update rates over **10 kHz**, exceeding practical requirements for interactive orientation sensing.

## 4. Conclusion

The AHRS module demonstrates excellent real-time characteristics. With a total execution time of less than 70 µs per update, the module can sustain rapid updates and is well-suited for real-time embedded applications.
