# ðŸ“˜ Class Design Rationale for FluxSand

This document explains the rationale behind the class architecture in the FluxSand embedded system project. Our objective is to create a modular, testable, and extensible design that adheres to solid software engineering principles while efficiently interfacing with real-time hardware.

## ðŸ§± Hardware Abstraction Layer (HAL)

### `Gpio`, `I2cDevice`, `SpiDevice`, `PWM`

These foundational classes abstract hardware-level operations such as GPIO configuration, I2C/SPI communication, and PWM control on the Raspberry Pi platform.

- **Single Responsibility Principle (SRP):** Each class manages exactly one type of hardware peripheral.
- **Open/Closed Principle (OCP):** They are designed to be extended (e.g., injected into drivers like `Mpu9250` or `Ads1115`) without requiring modification.
- **Dependency Inversion Principle (DIP):** Upper layers (like `SensorManager` or `InputHandler`) depend only on the abstraction of hardware, not specific implementations.

**Example usage:**
```cpp
Gpio button1("gpiochip0", 23, false);
SpiDevice spiDisplay("/dev/spidev1.0", 1000000, SPI_MODE_0);
```

## ðŸŽ› Device Drivers

### `Mpu9250`, `Aht20`, `Bmp280`, `Ads1115`, `Max7219`

Each device driver class encapsulates the full lifecycle and protocol logic of a specific sensor or actuator.

- **SRP:** Encapsulates initialization, register handling, data decoding, and calibration.
- **OCP:** Easy to add new sensor types with separate drivers.
- **LSP:** Interchangeable with alternative implementations without affecting client code (e.g., another IMU class).

These drivers decouple sensor-specific details from application logic.

---

## ðŸ”„ Computational Components

### `AHRS`, `InferenceEngine`, `SandGrid`

These logic-only modules handle signal processing, orientation estimation, machine learning inference, and visual simulations.

- **SRP:** Each component focuses on a single computation domain.
- **OCP/LSP:** Swappable models, configurable inference strategies, and reusable logic.
- `InferenceEngine` supports consensus voting and confidence filtering for robust gesture recognition.

## ðŸ§  Control and Coordination Modules

### `CompGuiX`, `ModeManager`, `SensorManager`, `InputHandler`, `InferenceHandler`, `FluxSand`

These higher-level modules act as coordinators between inputs, logic, and output rendering.

| Class              | Responsibility                                  |
| ------------------ | ----------------------------------------------- |
| `CompGuiX`         | GUI rendering, time display, sand simulation    |
| `ModeManager`      | Mode switching, stopwatch and timer logic       |
| `SensorManager`    | Aggregates and filters sensor data              |
| `InputHandler`     | Manages GPIO interrupt handling and input logic |
| `InferenceHandler` | Maps model output to application actions        |
| `FluxSand`         | Top-level orchestrator of all system components |

Each class has a focused role and collaborates via callbacks and shared interfaces.

- **DIP:** Each handler uses only references to high-level abstractions.
- **ISP:** Modules expose minimal interfaces (e.g., time rendering or orientation control only).

---

## ðŸ§ª Testability and Extensibility

- All hardware classes can be mocked for unit testing.
- Modules expose unit test functions (e.g., `RunUnitTest()`).
- Logic and IO are decoupled to support simulation, CI, or deployment to other boards.

## âœ… Summary: Class Design at a Glance

| Principle | Applied Through                                       |
| --------- | ----------------------------------------------------- |
| SRP       | Clear responsibility boundaries for each class        |
| OCP       | Easy to add features or sensors without code changes  |
| LSP       | Subclassing works transparently with clients          |
| ISP       | Interfaces expose only what is needed                 |
| DIP       | Logic depends on abstractions, not hardware specifics |

This design allows FluxSand to scale from a classroom prototype to a fully featured embedded platform with minimal refactoring.
