# ‚è±Ô∏è How Realtime Performance Was Achieved

This document outlines the key architectural and implementation techniques used in the FluxSand project to meet the realtime programming requirements of ENG 5220. Our design prioritizes low latency, responsiveness, and correctness under timing constraints.

## 1Ô∏è‚É£ Interrupt-Driven Design Instead of Polling

### ‚úÖ GPIO Input Handling
- The `Gpio` class supports edge-triggered interrupt callbacks using `EnableInterruptRisingEdgeWithCallback()`.
- Physical buttons wake up the `InputHandler` via hardware interrupts.
- Avoids busy-wait loops or CPU-intensive polling.

### ‚úÖ ADS1115 Conversion Completion Interrupt
- The ADC's `ALERT/RDY` pin connects to a GPIO and signals data-ready via an interrupt.
- `Ads1115` uses this to schedule safe, efficient per-channel data reads.

> üìå Implemented using `libgpiod` + background threads blocked on `gpiod_line_event_wait()`, making the system fully event-driven.

## 2Ô∏è‚É£ Multithreaded Decoupling for Concurrent Realtime Tasks

Each major subsystem runs in a dedicated thread:

| Thread             | Responsibility                              |
|--------------------|---------------------------------------------|
| `AHRS::ThreadTask()` | Updates orientation estimation              |
| `InferenceEngine::InferenceTask()` | Runs ONNX inference logic asynchronously |
| `CompGuiX::ThreadFun()` | Simulates sand physics and updates display   |
| `Mpu9250::CalibrateThreadTask()` | Runs long-duration background IMU calibration |

This separation ensures that:
- GUI remains responsive even during heavy computation.
- Inference latency does not stall sensor acquisition.
- Long calibration tasks do not interfere with user inputs.

> ‚úÖ Thread synchronization is done using `std::binary_semaphore`, ensuring safety and data freshness.

## 3Ô∏è‚É£ Callback-Driven Data Flow and Event Handling

All modules communicate via callbacks instead of polling or shared flags:

```text
MPU9250 interrupt
  ‚Üí AHRS::OnData(accel, gyro)
    ‚Üí InferenceEngine::OnData(...)
      ‚Üí OnModelResult callback
        ‚Üí GUI rendering or mode switch
```

This event cascade ensures low-latency and deterministic response to physical motion or user input.

## 4Ô∏è‚É£ Latency Considerations and Measured Timings

| Realtime Path                          | Typical Latency   |
|----------------------------------------|-------------------|
| GPIO button press ‚Üí callback           | < 3ms             |
| Gesture motion ‚Üí inference ‚Üí GUI update| < 50ms            |
| AHRS update frequency                  | ~100Hz            |

All major paths have been analyzed and kept within interactive response times.

## 5Ô∏è‚É£ Avoiding Non-Realtime Traps

We deliberately avoided common pitfalls that break realtime performance:

| Bad Practice               | What We Used Instead                        |
|---------------------------|---------------------------------------------|
| Busy loops / `sleep()`    | Semaphores, callbacks, and hardware IRQs    |
| Main thread blocking      | Multithreading with clear separation        |
| Polling sensors repeatedly| Interrupt-based data-ready signaling        |
| Using delays for timing   | `std::chrono` and thread sleeping per cycle |

## ‚úÖ Summary

The realtime strategy for FluxSand focuses on:

- **Interrupts over polling**
- **Threaded execution of independent logic**
- **Asynchronous data processing via callbacks**
- **Quantifiable latency and accurate timing**
- **Safe synchronization using semaphores**

This architecture ensures predictable, fast, and robust interaction for a physical embedded system running under Linux.
