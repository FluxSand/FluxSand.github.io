# Real-Time Performance Evaluation

## 1. System Configuration

- **Kernel Version**: 6.6.73-rt47-v8-16k-RTLC+
- **Scheduler Policy**: SCHED_FIFO
- **Test Tool**: `cyclictest`
- **Test Parameters**:
  - Priority: 95
  - Interval: 1000 μs
  - Duration: 1 minute
  - Threads: 4

## 2. Test Results

| Thread | Min Latency (μs) | Avg Latency (μs) | Max Latency (μs) |
|--------|------------------|------------------|------------------|
| 0      | 1                | 2                | 14               |
| 1      | 1                | 2                | 8                |
| 2      | 1                | 2                | 13               |
| 3      | 1                | 2                | 10               |

## 3. Analysis

- The maximum observed latency is only **14 μs**, which indicates excellent real-time responsiveness.
- All threads reported very **consistent low latencies**, both in terms of minimum and average values.
- The **low jitter** suggests a stable real-time environment with efficient scheduling.

## 4. Conclusion

The system demonstrates **outstanding real-time performance**, with low, stable, and predictable response characteristics. It is well-suited for real-time embedded applications like FluxSand.
