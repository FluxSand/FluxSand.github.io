# GUI Module Real-Time Evaluation

## 1. Description

This report documents the results of unit tests for the **GUI (Graphical User Interface)** module of the FluxSand system, responsible for rendering visual elements such as time, numbers, temperature, humidity, and the animated sand flow.

Although specific timing metrics were not recorded during testing, the sequence of operations was verified for correctness, indicating functional reliability of the visual interface layer.

## 2. Functional Test Coverage

The following rendering operations were exercised during the unit test:

- ✅ Draw number (`42`) in portrait mode
- ✅ Draw time (`12:34`) in both portrait and landscape modes
- ✅ Render humidity icon
- ✅ Render temperature icon
- ✅ Enable sand animation
- ✅ Reset sand state
- ✅ Disable sand animation

All tests completed successfully without error.

## 3. Analysis

- While **no explicit timing data** was collected, the comprehensive set of rendering functions were tested in sequence without failure or timeout.
- The responsiveness of these GUI operations is indirectly validated by their successful execution under real-time test conditions.
- Future instrumentation with microsecond-level profiling is recommended to quantify frame rendering latency, especially under heavy load or frequent updates.

## 4. Conclusion

The GUI module has passed all functional unit tests, demonstrating reliable operation for time and sensor data visualization. Although real-time timing data is unavailable, the successful execution of the full rendering suite suggests that the GUI performs adequately within the system's real-time constraints.
